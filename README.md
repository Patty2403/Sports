Project Description
At Easton School there are a limited variety of sports. Our school is lacking sports fields and a  track. With greater facilities our school could grow. Easton School could advertise new sports at our school. We could add new sports activities into physical education and extracurricular activities for students. If we get more sports there might be more kids interested in attending Easton School. Thatâ€™s why we need more sporting facilities to improve our school and community.
